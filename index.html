                    <h2>Octopus</h2>
                    <p>An octopus is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc. 
                     An octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beaked mouth at the center point of the eight limbs. The soft body can radically alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as they swim. </p>

                    <h2>Size</h2>
                    <p>The giant Pacific octopus is often cited as the largest known octopus species. Adults usually weigh around 15 kg, with an arm span of up to 4.3 m. The largest specimen of this species to be scientifically documented was an animal with a live mass of 71 kg.</p>

                    <h2>Nervous system and senses</h2>
                    <p>Octopuses have the highest brain-to-body mass ratios of all invertebrates;] this is greater than that of many vertebrates. The nervous system is complex, only part of which is localised in its brain. Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons are in the nerve cords of its arms; these are capable of complex reflex actions without input from the brain.</p>

                    <h2>Ink sac</h2>
                    <p>The ink sac of an octopus is located under the digestive gland. A gland attached to the sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is close enough to the funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. </p>

                    <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
                    <p>Octopuses live in every ocean, and different species have adapted to different marine habitats. As juveniles, common octopuses inhabit shallow tide pools. The Hawaiian day octopus lives on coral reefs; argonauts drift in pelagic waters. Abdopus aculeatus mostly lives in near-shore seagrass beds. Some species are adapted to the cold, ocean depths. The spoon-armed octopus is found at depths of 1,000 m, and Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis lives near hydrothermal vents at 2,000 m.</p>
